# Detecting-fake-news-using-Python
This python project used a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. 
I used a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well the model performs. It ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.82% in magnitude.
